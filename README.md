# CompassCourse_Online-Marketing-Plan
It's an online marketing plan for a start-up business (Group project - Our own business idea)

## EcoStation - Eco for today and tomorrow (Online Marketing)

The objective of this exercise is to learn and implement the online marketing basics for a start-up brand developed or conceptualised by us. Taking up imaginary budget and details, we learned how to implement and grow the business through organic and paid marketing medium. 

This was part of my orientation project with StartSteps.
